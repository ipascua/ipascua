                        <p>Pilipino Cultural Night (PCN) is a production hosted by the Pilipino Cultural Exchange (PCE) that serves as a vibrant celebration of Pilipino and Filipino-American identity, culture, and history. With its inception in the late 70s, PCN has become an annual tradition, and this year marked the remarkable 34th production organized by the PCE. Titled "Binibini," PCN 34 revolved around the captivating story of a family with three sisters, who grappled with the challenges of breaking free from parental expectations and the burden of generational trauma. The narrative unfolded through a compelling combination of a theatrical play, traditional Pilipino dances,  modern dance forms, and enchanting choir performances. To ensure maximum participation and enjoyment, "Binibini" was presented over a weekend, providing an opportunity for family, friends, and Cal Poly alumni to come together and witness the brilliance of the show. It served as a platform to unite the community, educate and inspire, and to honor the rich heritage that defines Pilipino and Filipino-American culture.</p>

                        <p>Ating Himig, PCE's non-audition choir, is more than just a musical group. It is a community that comes together to create beautiful melodies and meaningful connections. The name Ating Himig, which translates to "our melody" in Tagalog, holds a profound significance for us. It represents the unity and strength we find in our collective voices. Within this choir, we have discovered the power to uplift and support one another, forming a true sense of family. Our journey together has revealed our playful, authentic selves, filled with laughter and joy. At the same time, we have nurtured our passion, determination, and hard work. Ating Himig performed "Lupang Hinirang", "Forevermore", "Lullaby", "Just the Way You Are", and "Man in the Mirror."</p>

                        <p>Kasayahan, derived from the Tagalog word for "celebration," encapsulates PCE's joyous homage to Filipino culture through the captivating art form of traditional dance. By taking part in Kasayahan, participants not only entertain but also embark on a profound learning journey about the rich heritage of the Philippines. Each dance performed holds cultural significance, serving as a conduit for educating both the audience and our performers about Filipino traditions. Regardless of prior dance experience, all are welcome to join and learn from fellow members. Engaging in this uplifting experience provides an opportunity to gain knowledge, appreciation, and a deeper understanding of our culture and history. Through the vibrant movements and rhythmic expressions of Kasayahan, we come together to celebrate and preserve the beauty of Filipino traditions for generations to come. Kasayahan performed Valse Vieja, Sayaw sa Bangko, Idaw, Vinta, and Tinikling.</p>
